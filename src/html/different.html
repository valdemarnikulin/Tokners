                        There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter, tiktok, Instagram and YouTube
                        with followings in the millions who we would be actively engaging before we go viral.

                        platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital economy where their

                        their channels while our native token holders benefit from the Tokners popularity.
