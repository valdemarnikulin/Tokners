                        population with some countries
                        and entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds
                        holding the fort.

                            Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched all
                            aiming to fix one problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal
                            is
                            to bring mass adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So
                            down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and have them
                            download an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite person and watch their
                            investment as is with other cryptocurrency project.

                            We are trying to do to this space what
                            investment apps did for the "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamefying digital
                            currency,
                            bringing in popular faces instead of hard to understand projects to make it the norm and
                            inadvertently being the "gateway drug" for a lot of people to finally give this space a real
                            look.

                        A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as countries and creators
                        would be paid beyond the peanuts that conventional social media platforms can offer.

                            There
                            would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find home there. Like
                            Kanye
                            said, "Personalities would become the new currency, and services would be built on top of
                            them".
                            Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like something we hope he would say.

                            Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now, but this time there would be no
                            dead
                            presidents on the money, there would people like you on the money, and you would own it
                            because it would make the most sense in the world.
